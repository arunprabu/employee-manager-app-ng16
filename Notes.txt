Angular 16 

Webapps 
-------
  1. Server Side Rendering Apps (SSR)
      * Pages will reload / refresh 

      Arch: 
        1 App: HTML, CSS, JS, Back End Code, DB query 

      In 1 Server the whole app will be deployed 

      Disadvantages 
      -------
        1. Slower Webapps
        2. High Bandwidth Consumption 
        3. Expensive 
        4. Not offering better UX 
        5. Server is doing the heavy lifting 

  2. Client Side Rendering Apps (CSR) = SPA + RESTful API 
      * Pages will not reload / refresh 

      Arch: 
        Front End App: HTML, CSS, JS 
          Single Page Apps 

        Back End App: Back end + DB Query 
          RESTful API 

      2 Servers are needed to host both the apps 

      Advantages
      --------
        1. Faster Webapps
        2. Less Bandwidth Consumption 
        3. Not Expensive 
        4. offering better UX 
        5. Server's workload is shared between two servers

      Disadvantages
      ----  
        1. Initial Loading will take longer 
        2. NOT Search Engine Friendly 
      

Single Page Apps (SPA)
-------
  7 Characteristics 
  ---------------
    1. Pages should not reload
    2. URL should change 
    3. History should be maintained without page refresh 
    4. Header and Footer should be intact -- w/o loading again and again 
    5. Main section should show contextual updates. 
    6. Active Menu should be set 
    7. Page title should also be changed

Routing in Angular
===================
  Step 0: Identify the menus and the urls 
          Home              - http://localhost:4200/
          Concepts          - http://localhost:4200/concepts
          About Us          - http://localhost:4200/about-us
          Contact Us        - http://localhost:4200/contact-us

  Step 1: Let's setup the identified urls in menu-list.comp's template in hrefs 

  Step 2: Check the app. URLs will not be stable. 
          Let's work on to create the necessary components
          ng g c home/components/home -t -s 
          ng g c concepts/components/concepts -s 
          ng g c about-us/components/about-us -s -t
          ng g c contact-us/components/contact-us -s -t

  Step 3: Let's config the routing in app-routing.module.ts 
  
  Step 4: Check the app. URLs will be stable. 
          Let's load the component in between header and footer.
          in app.comp.html 
          in between header and footer, add <router-outlet></router-outlet>

  Step 5: Check the app. Page will still refresh. Let's fix it. 
          in menu.comp template, replace href with routerLink. 


  Routing is over!..

Naming Conventions & Casing Conventions
-------
Casing Types 
--------
  1. PascalCase 
      * Recommended for Object Oriented Program's classes 
      * also Recommended for Interface in Java & TypeScript 
      * also needed for Enum

      examples 
      ---
        class CarDetails {

        }

        interface Employee {

        }

  2. camelCase 
      * Recommended for variables, const, functions, methods in JS & TS 
      * Recommended for id's of html 

      examples 
      -----
        var myCar = 'BMW';

        function getCarInfo() {
          //....
        }
  
  3. kebab-case
      * Recommended for URLs 
      * Recommended for file names, folder names (if not react), assets in front end projects 
      * Recommended for css classes 
      * Recommended for custom attributes
      * okay for id's of html elements if your architect says okay

      examples 
      -----
        btn-primary
        slideshow-container
        youtube-logo.png 

  4. snake_case
      * never ever use this. 
      * okay for const in JS & TS if architect accepts

      examples
      ---
        const MAX_STUDENTS_PER_CLASS = 30;

Directives
------
  * Special Instructions to the DOM

  1. Attribute Directives
      examples: routerLink, routerLinkActive, routerLinkActiveOptions

  2. Structural Directives
      => impacts will be on html (structural layer)
        *ngIf (used for conditional rendering )

        *ngFor (used for looping thru)

        ngSwitch [TODO]

  3. Custom Attribute Directives

------------------------------------------
Forms in Angular 
------
  1. Template Driven Forms 
      * created with html 
      * easiest 

      Disadvantages 
      ----
        1. Not suitable for complex form validations 
        2. Not suitable for unit testing

  2. Reactive Forms [RECOMMENDED]
      * created with html and ts 
      * easy

      Advantages 
      ------
        1. suitable for complex form validations 
        2. suitable for unit testing

Modules
------
  Feature Module 
    ng g m employees/employees --flat -m=app

  Feature Routing Module 
    ng g m employees/employees-routing --flat -m=employees

----
Interfaces (15 mins)

Products Feature for any to any comp commns 
  Subscription


Authentication (2.5 hours)
----
  Guards
  HttpInterceptor


Guards
----
  * like securirty guards 
  * to pretect routes
  * one of building blocks of angular
  * return true or false 

  ng g g shared/guards/auth 



Authentication Flow 
----
  Signup 
  Login 
    email, password 
      if both are valid then backend will generate JWT (token) and send it to the browser 
        * browser should store JWT in either cookie or local storage or session storage
        * then, upon every subsequent request to the backend -- the JWT should be sent to the Back End (i.e BearerToken)
          ... should be sent in request.header
        * backend will verify JWT -- if looks valid, then only Backend will send the successful res 
        * otherwise, backend will send negative res asking the user to login again 

      if credentials invalid, then backend will throw error to the browser

      Setup Tools to Test our app 


Automation Testing 
------
  0. Static Type Checking 
      Tools: TypeScript

  1. Unit Testing - [TO LEARN]
      * Testing the tiny, individual unit 
      * Testing the building blocks in isolation (without connecting to REST API)
      * writing code to test our code 
      * bug reduction density: 40-80% 

      Tools: 
        
        Jasmine JS (Unit Testing Framework)
        Karma (Test Runner)

  2. Integration Testing  
      * Different units, modules, or components tested as combined entity 
      * Behavior of the app would be tested 
      * Used for exposing issues in the integration of multiple units 

      Example: [testing if a child comp can update parent comp]

      Tools: Jasmine JS, Karma 

  3. End to End Testing 
      * Testing the whole app 
      * usually a multi-step test combining multiple units and integration tests into one big test 
      * tests are done in simulated browser; there may or may not be UI while the tests are running 

      Tools: Selenium or CypressJS or Protractor or Cucumber or Tosca or Playwright

-------------------------

2 Approaches / Modern Software Dev Methodologies (as of 2023)
----------------
  dev writes test cases => dev writes fn code => (TOOLS) => instant feedback of success / failure 

  1. Test Driven Development (TDD)
      * is a programming practice that instructs the dev to write NEW code only if an automation test failed 

      dev writes test cases 
        (Instant Feedback of Success / Error)
          dev writes fn code (only if error occurs)
            (Instant Feedback of Success / Error)
              [CODE COMPLETE if success]

      Testing Pattern: AAA (Arrange, Act, Assert)
      Tools: JEST, Mocha, Chai 


  2. Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) - TO LEARN
      * is an agile dev Methodology 
      * an app is documented and designed around the behaviour the end user wants to experience 

      dev writes test cases (around the behaviour of the app)
        (Instant Feedback of Success / Error)
          dev writes fn code (only if error occurs)
            (Instant Feedback of Success / Error)
              [CODE COMPLETE if success]

      Testing Pattern: Given/When/Then
      Tools: Jasmine JS
